DeepaMehta 4 Box Renderer
=========================

A simple DeepaMehta 4 plugin that illustrates the development of a View Customizer and Viewmodel Customizer.

The DeepaMehta 4 Box Renderer replaces the look & feel of DeepaMehta's default topicmap renderer. The default topic rendering (icon + label) is replaced by "label in blue box + mini icon". The label is not truncated. The mini icon acts as a handle to create new associations.

Original idea + design by Torsten Ziegler.

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
